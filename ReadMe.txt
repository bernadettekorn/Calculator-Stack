Bugs:
	If user input for a polynomial doesn't end with
	a ; then it runs into issues.

Special Steps to compile:
	Needs Token.hpp Token.cpp Term.hpp Term.cpp
	Polynomial.hpp and Polynomial.hpp files to 
	run

Approach: 
	I created the stack class and the functions it
	needed first. Then wrote source.cpp and created 
	the functions needed to carry out the calculations
